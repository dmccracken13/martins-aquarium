          <h3>Travel Tips</h3>
          <p>Do a practice dive. This is highly recommended as it is a chance to get familiar with snorkeling gear,
            practice breathing techniques, and get comfortable in the water.</p>
          <p>Ensure you have the right gear. Styles, sizes and prices are all things to consider when getting snorkeling
            gear. It is also important to decide whether you want to invest in your own equipment or rent some out for
            the
            day.</p>
          <p>Choose a location. Several factors are important when selecting a location. Choose one that matches your
            level of experience and inquire about regular sea life sightings in that area before making a commitment.
            Understand that the day you choose may not be the best day for sightings. Nevertheless, you’re bound to spot
            something exciting!</p>

            <p>Komodo National Park (Indonesian: Taman Nasional Komodo) is a national park in Indonesia located within
              the
              Lesser Sunda Islands in the border region between the provinces of East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa
              Tenggara. The park includes the three larger islands Komodo, Padar and Rinca, and 26 smaller ones,[2] with
              a
              total area of 1,733 km2 (603 km2 of it land). The national park was founded in 1980 to protect the Komodo
              dragon, the world's largest lizard.[3] Later it was dedicated to protecting other species, including
              marine
              species. In 1991 the national park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[4]

              Komodo National Park has been selected as one of the New7Wonders of Nature.[5] The waters surrounding
              Komodo
              island contain rich marine biodiversity. Komodo islands is also a part of the Coral Triangle, which
              contains
              some of the richest marine biodiversity on Earth.</p>

            <p>The Caribbean Sea (Spanish: Mar Caribe; French: Mer des Caraïbes; Haitian Creole: Lamè Karayib; Jamaican
              Patois: Kiaribiyan Sii; Dutch: Caraïbische Zee; Papiamento: Laman Karibe) is an American mediterranean sea
              of the Atlantic Ocean in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere. It is bounded by Mexico and Central
              America
              to the west and south west, to the north by the Greater Antilles starting with Cuba, to the east by the
              Lesser Antilles, and to the south by the north coast of South America.

              The entire area of the Caribbean Sea, the numerous islands of the West Indies, and adjacent coasts, are
              collectively known as the Caribbean. The Caribbean Sea is one of the largest seas and has an area of about
              2,754,000 km2 (1,063,000 sq mi).[1][2] The sea's deepest point is the Cayman Trough, between the Cayman
              Islands and Jamaica, at 7,686 m (25,217 ft) below sea level. The Caribbean coastline has many gulfs and
              bays: the Gulf of Gonâve, Gulf of Venezuela, Gulf of Darién, Golfo de los Mosquitos, Gulf of Paria and
              Gulf
              of Honduras.


              Coral reef, near Soufrière Quarter, Saint Lucia
              The Caribbean Sea has the world's second largest barrier reef, the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef. It runs
              1,000
              km (620 mi) along the coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras.[3]</p>

            <h4>Devil's Crown, Galápagos Islands</h4>
            <img src="https://www.sancristobalgalapagos.gob.ec/en/images/corona.jpg">
            <li>Geo Coordinates: 1.2748, 90.4864</li>
            <p>Located off of Floreana Island, the Devil's Crown is a ring of jagged rocks that jut out of the water
              not
              too far from shore. They get their name from the fact that they look roughly like a crown: they are in a
              circle and rather pointy when seen from a distance. The rest of the name comes from the notion that only
              the
              Devil could wear something so uncomfortable! The Devil's Crown was once a volcanic crater, ages ago. As
              the
              earth's crust moved, the volcano became inactive, and time eroded most of it away, leaving only a few
              rocks.
              It's fortunate that these rocks are still there, as many think the Devil's Crown is the premier
              snorkelling
              spot in all of Galapagos. SCUBA divers also like to dive there, as there is a chance of seeing some
              spectacular marine life.
              Why is it such a great place to snorkel? There are several reasons. First of all, the rocks make the site
              an
              attractive place for small fish, which form a key link in the food chain. These attract larger fish, and
              so
              on. Snorkelers can expect to see a variety of dazzling reef fish at Devil's Crown. Because it is so close
              to
              shore, it is relatively protected from winds and currents, and although the swimming is challenging, it is
              not as hard as it would be further out. On one side of the rocks, the water is deep and the current is
              swift: this is where lucky snorkelers occasionally see something spectacular, such as a Hammerhead Shark,
              White-tipped Reef Shark, sea turtle, or large ray such as a Manta or Spotted Eagle Ray.</p>

        <h2>Tank Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
          <li> Salinity/Topping Off: Daily
            Heated saltwater tanks, even with a tight-fitting lid, will lose water to evaporation. When this happens,
            you
            will notice your salinity starts to increase. This is because when the water leaves your tank, the salt
            stays
            behind, becoming more concentrated. To correct this, you will need to add heated FRESHWATER on a regular
            basis.
            It will feel very odd at first, but this will keep your salinity stable. Make sure your salinity stays in
            range
            using a hydrometer or refractometer.</li>
          <li>Water Changes: Weekly
            For the first few months of your saltwater aquarium, you will need to keep a strict water change schedule.
            When
            you first set up a tank and get it cycled, it will take some time for all your trophic levels to balance
            out.
            This is the balance between the new fish you just added, any invertebrates, such as corals or shrimp, and
            your
            biological filtration. Once your tank is fully cycled, you may still have a few hiccups over the first 6-8
            months. Regular water changes will help keep these from becoming a bigger problem later. This is especially
            true
            if you plan to keep adding live elements, such as fish or live rock, and are still finessing your equipment
            setup.</li>
          <li> a gravel or sand siphon to get into the deeper layers of your substrate. This will not hurt the bacteria
            living in the substrate! If you can, move your décor or live rock and vacuum underneath. You’d be surprised
            how
            much debris can pile up these elements. Be cautious not to disturb any bottom dwellers! You can make new
            piles
            of substrate for any burrowing fish, but be sure not to suck them up or squish them.</li>
          <li> Maintaining Filtration: Weekly
            Part of your water change regimen should be inspecting your filter media. No matter what kind of filter
            media
            you choose, it should allow water to flow freely and not collect lots of debris. You never want to replace
            your
            filter media unless it is falling apart. After you have collected your waste water from your water change,
            use
            that water to rinse your filtration. Never rinse your filter media in freshwater. Once you have removed the
            larger debris, be sure to wipe out the container and replace the media. It will not look or smell
            clean–that’s
            the point! You want to keep your biological filtration bacteria in their place.</li>
          <li> Saltwater: As Needed
            If you are keeping saltwater fish, you will need a way to collect or make saltwater. If you live close to a
            beach and plan on collecting water, make sure it has been properly tested and is allowed by your local laws.
            It
            is strongly recommended that you sterilize “wild” water for at least 24 hours with a UV sterilizer so you
            don’t
            bring in any dangerous or nuisance pathogens from the wild.

            If you don’t have access to a supply of ready-made seawater, you will have to make your own. You can start
            with
            tap, well or RO water. If you are using tap or well water, be sure it is tested prior to making your
            saltwater.
            There are many different salt mixes you can use, and they will be specific to an all-fish saltwater aquarium
            or
            one for fish and corals. Corals require more carbonate and phosphate to make their rocky homes and will need
            these coral-specific salt mixes. When you are first getting started with saltwater, it is recommended that
            you
            start with fish only. Adding corals will require more specific tank, light, water flow and saltwater
            requirements.</li>
          <li>Scrub Algae: Weekly
            Fish + water = algae; there’s no way around it. If you have corals, their strong lights will often make
            algae
            problems worse. Scrubbing your glass or acrylic with an appropriate scrubber on a regular basis will help
            with
            build up. If you have a severe algae problem, check your water quality. Lots of phosphate and nitrate will
            cause
            algae blooms.</li>
          <li>Check Water Quality: Daily/Weekly/Monthly
            Maintaining good water quality is essential to ALL aquariums, both fresh and saltwater. A good saltwater
            aquarium plan will allow your system to be set up correctly with proper filtration. When you are first
            starting
            out and your tank is still cycling, you will need to check your water chemistry daily. This is especially
            critical if you are cycling your tank with fish. Once you have made it past the initial cycling period, you
            can
            scale back to checking your water chemistry weekly, but only if you are not in the process of adding more
            fish,
            invertebrates or equipment. If you are still adding elements, keep testing daily. Waiting too long between
            testing when you are still manipulating your nitrogen cycle can be disastrous if you do not catch any
            problems
            early. Once you are done adding or making changes to your system, give it 4 weeks to settle out, then you
            can
            start cutting back on your testing.

            Saltwater fish are significantly more strict about their pH than most freshwater fish. It is critical to
            maintain a consistent pH for any saltwater system. Most salt mixes will include enough carbonate buffers to
            keep
            your pH stable, but it is still important to check regularly.

            Replace your liquid-based test kit yearly. The “expiration dates” printed on the packages are only for the
            stores that sell them. Once you open the bottles, you have one year to use the liquid. If you are using an
            electronic probe, be sure to calibrate it at least once a month per the manufacturer’s instructions.

            The only parameter you must always test daily is temperature. Do not rely on sticky, external thermometers.
            Invest a few dollars in a submerged thermometer or a few more for a fancy digital one. Check it daily to
            make
            sure your heaters are functioning correctly. Cold saltwater fish are not happy and will easily sicken and
            die.
